    <p> Hi, I am <strong><em>Bhim Sen Mishra.</em></strong> I am a professional <em><strong>E-commerce Project Manager</strong> </em>with more than 2 years of experience in planning, designing, developing and managing IT projects. My inclination towards programming started in 10<sup>th </sup>grade when I got familiar with HTML as a part of my curriculum. Continuing this I choose Computer Science with Mathematics and Physics as my majors in High school. There I was introduced with basic programming languages <em><strong>C and C++</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Continuing education I graduated with a Bachelor’s of Computer Science, which inculcated in me advance programming skills including other languages like <em><strong>Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, SQL and PL/SQL</strong></em> and confronted me with its radical practical applications.</p>
<p>After my graduation, I joined “JK Enterprise” as a “System Analyst”, where I worked on SaaS projects and in improving the technical environment of the company.</p>
<p>In my quest for education that would add more professional skills and also will provide global exposure, I clicked into Project Management IT graduate certificate program in Seneca where I learned about various project development methodologies. In my second semester, I landed to a startup “American Tall” as “Project Coordinator Intern” and helped them build their web store using Shopify.</p>
<p>I also have a Diploma in Financial Services and International Business Management which have deepened my knowledge of developing professional business plan, finance and accounting principles with Canadian legal framework.</p>
<p>Apart from this, I have received acclamation for my research papers on “Golden Ratio” and “Partial Derivatives”. Recently I have received “<em><strong>Award of Excellence 2017</strong></em>” from “<em><strong>Seneca College</strong></em>” for winning “HRSA Business Case Competition” drafted by <em><strong>Ivey and ISB business schools</strong></em>.  </p>
<p>Thanks for patiently reading this post and considering my efforts worth noticing. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sincere regards,</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Bhim Sen Mishra</strong></em></p>
